# intro-assignment-sp24

Hello and welcome to Purdue AIM! This is the repo containing the introductory assignment for Spring 2024 researchers and VIP students.

Here is your assignment:

1. Decide whether you are using Google Colab or your local machine. Google Colab has free GPUs for those who don't have access to Nvidia GPUs on their local machine.
2. Fork this repository into a new private repository under your GitHub account.
3. Clone the repository to your machine or Colab, whichever you are using.
4. There are 4 assignments to complete in the assignments folder (3 of which were pulled from HuggingFace and one which was primarily written by Tim). Complete these assignments to the best of your ability.
5. Commit and push any changes to new or existing files to your repository.
6. Share your repository link on Brightspace to finish submission.
