# Introduction to AIM Assignment Spring 2024

Hello and welcome to Purdue AIM! This is the repo containing the introductory assignment for Spring 2024 researchers and VIP students.

Here is your assignment:

1. Decide whether you are using Google Colab or your local machine. Google Colab has free GPUs for those who don't have access to Nvidia GPUs on their local machine.
2. Fork this repository into a new private repository under your GitHub account. Make sure no one but instructors/student leaders can see it; showing it to anyone else is academic dishonesty!
3. Make a new branch titled "changes".
4. Clone this branch to your machine or Colab, whichever you are using.
5. There are 4 assignments to complete in the assignments folder (3 of which were pulled from HuggingFace and one which was primarily written by Tim). Complete these assignments to the best of your ability.
6. Commit and push any changes to new or existing files to the branch titled "changes".
7. Pull request and merge your changes into the master branch.
8. Create, add, commit, and push a .txt file called "Collaborators.txt" stating who you worked with and what outside resources you used to complete this assignment (other than student leaders/TAs/professors).
9. Share your repository link on Brightspace to finish submission.

In summary, when submitting, you should have the 4 notebooks in "Assignments" done, the two MIDI files from the MIDI synth assignment + Collaborators.txt file included, and a Git history of merging the "changes" branch in.

If you need help with this assignment, your first point of contact should be Microsoft Teams - there is a channel for questions called "Intro Assignment Spring 2024". You can also reach out to peers for help with the assignment. Failing that, you should contact student leaders for help.
Since most of you joined this VIP class/research team by choice, there should be no need or desire to cheat on this assignment. It may seem lengthy initially, but we want to ensure that everyone has a solid foundation for doing research this semester. Failure to properly attempt the assignments will likely cause trouble down the road when you have to do these sorts of tasks independently. As such, even if it's not cheating, you should aim to complete the assignments primarily by yourself without "relying" on others to drag you through. There is a fine line between using others' help efficiently and overusing it.
