    "This assignment is meant to ensure you have experience with fine-tuning a pretrained model for an audio classification task. You can use the following resources to help you:\n",
    "- *https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter4/classification_models*\n",
    "- *https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter4/fine-tuning*\n",
    "- *https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter4/demo*\n",
    "- Any of the previous notebooks\n",

    "The HuggingFace tutorials above demonstrated how to fine-tune a Hubert model on marsyas/gtzan dataset for music classification. Their example achieved 83% accuracy. Your task is to improve upon this accuracy metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to choose any model on the HuggingFace Hub that you think is suitable for audio classification. However, you should use the exact same dataset (marsyas/gtzan) to build your own classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to achieve 87% accuracy on this dataset with your classifier. You can choose the exact same model, and play with the training hyperparameters, or pick an entirely different model - itâ€™s up to you!\n",
    "\n",
